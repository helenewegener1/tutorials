“What cutoff should I use for p-value, log2FC, or mito content?”

This is the most common question I get.

Here's why it’s not simple:

"Tommy, what’s the p-value cutoff for DE genes?"

"What log2FC should I use?"

"What’s the mito% for QC in scRNA-seq?"

Sound familiar?

My honest answer: it depends.

I often joke that 90% of a bioinformatician’s job is figuring out cutoffs.

Let me explain why.


Let’s start with p-values.

With huge sample sizes, even small differences yield tiny p-values.

Like 1e-20 small.

This happens in single-cell RNA-seq.

You cluster cells, then test for DE genes between clusters.

That’s double dipping.

So p-values become artificially small.

You may see thousands of genes with significant p-values.

But is that useful?

That’s why we look at effect size.

In RNA-seq, it's usually log2 Fold Change.

Biology matters more than stats.

A common log2FC cutoff is 1 (i.e., 2-fold change).

But again—it depends.

This is just a convenient threshold.

Sometimes, only a few genes pass log2FC = 1.

You might need to relax the cutoff to find meaningful hits.

It's about prioritization.

Is a 50% change important?

Let’s see two real examples.

X-chromosome inactivation escape:

Some genes increase ~50% in females vs males.

This can drive disease phenotypes.

Beta-thalassemia:

A 50% drop in HBB gene expression causes anemia, splenomegaly, and skeletal abnormalities.

So yes, small fold changes can be biologically significant.

The numbers must be interpreted in context.

Now let’s talk single-cell QC.

“What mito% should I use to filter cells?”

You’ll hear 5%, 10%, or 20% thrown around.

Mito gene expression is a proxy for dying cells.

But some tissues have naturally high mitochondrial content.

Muscle and kidney, for example, are metabolically active.

High mito% is normal for them—not a sign of low quality.

Same applies to ribosomal genes.

Naive T cells and some cancer cells express lots of ribosomal genes by design.

These aren’t low-quality cells.

They reflect real biology.

Use caution with rigid cutoffs.

There are data-driven tools like miQC:

https://lnkd.in/e7Kw22zN They estimate optimal cutoffs using your data.

Still, even tools like miQC aren’t foolproof.

You must understand the tissue and biology before trusting any threshold.

Key takeaways:
• P-values shrink with large sample sizes
• Log2FC tells you about effect size
• QC cutoffs vary by tissue
• Know your biology

Action items:
• Don’t blindly follow thresholds
• Interpret effect sizes contextually
• Use tools like miQC carefully
• Prioritize biological meaning

So next time you ask me for a cutoff,

My answer will still be:

It depends.
